# sfdx-live-agent-util

## Overview
Salesforce DX project. Utility service to separate LiveAgent configuartion on client from specific org and make a generic requests adjust by environment, example can be DV, QA, STAGE.

LiveAgent code snipets including Snapin JavaScript code generated by Salesforce is using several ORG IDs hardcoded in the generated code. Such IDs may work only for Production or potentially Full Snadboxes. When we develop on DEV sandbox or scratch orgs these IDs do not match and careate difficulty for DevOps and developer teams to move their projects across environments.

This small serfvice aim is to solve thi s problem by giving developers a REST service that can query all LiveAgent configurations for deployments or Buttons and make it dynamic by environment. Remove that hard binding
